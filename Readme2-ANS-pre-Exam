Enhanced Networking
===================
For high network bandwidth and throughput, consider using Jumbo
Frames, EC2 Enhanced Networking, Placement groups, EBS optimized
instances, DPDK
• Instance level network optimization with
• Enhanced Networking (SR-IOV, ENA, Intel VF 82599)
• Placement Groups
• EBS-Optimized Instances
• Operating system level network optimization with DPDK
• EFA is ENA with additional OS-bypass capability which provides further
improved network performance for HPC workloads
Within VPC the MTU size can be 9001 bytes with Jumbo Frames
• For the following cases the maximum MTU is 1500 bytes:
• Traffic over an internet gateway
• Traffic over an inter-region VPC peering connection
• Traffic over VPN connections
• When PPS is bottleneck, increased MTU provides more throughput
• While Enhanced Networking and placement groups lowers the latency
between EC2 and hypervisor, DPDK improves the packet processing at
OS level
